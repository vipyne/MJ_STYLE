              <p class="right">MIRANDA JACKSON is a freelance stylist and art director currently based in New York City. She represents the hard and the soft of femininity employing the likes of both Helmut Lang and Erdem, the ever consistent Alexander McQueen, Marc Jacobs, Lanvin, Phillip Lim and Jill Stuart. Isabél Marant is a current favorite. Miranda’s style is classic with an edge. With a bit of whimsy. But always with care and polish. Her influences include fashion icons: Priscilla Presley, Edie Sedgwick, Gwen Stefani, Courtney Love, Alison Mosshart, Karen O and her grandmother, Billie Jean.</p>

              <p class="right">Miranda spent her childhood summers in her grandmother’s boutique in Fort Worth, Texas, playing in the racks and presenting jewelry to the clientele. The littlest shopgirl fell in love with the feel of fabric and the transformative power of style. Going to market in Dallas with Billie Jean, Miranda studied her grandmother as she selected from each season to best suit the ladies she dressed. Being able to see beyond the clothing itself into the art of each individual’s potential to look and feel their best was Billie’s legacy.</p>

              <p>Everyone deserves to feel beautiful.</p>

              <p class="right">Born in Houston, Texas and raised in San Francisco and Seattle, Miranda lived and worked in the film industry in Los Angeles and New York for years with stints in Toronto, Japan and the UK.</p>
